# Dict_Translation
**Problem:**

Nima, due to his lack of proficiency in the English language, is required to attend international competitions accompanied by a translator. Since bringing another person for translation incurs high costs, Nima decides to look for an alternative solution. Now, you must assist Nima by writing a translator program. The program should read a dictionary and the corresponding sentence from the input and translate the sentence according to the specified language. If a word does not exist in the dictionary, print the word itself in the output.

The first line of input contains an integer, n, indicating the number of words present in the translation dictionary. Each of the next n lines consists of four words, where the second to fourth words represent translations of the first word. The second word is the English translation, the third word is the French translation, and the fourth word is the German translation of the first word. The last line contains a sentence that needs to be translated from either English, French, or German to the language of the first word. A sentence consists of multiple words separated by spaces. For more information, refer to the sample input and output.

(Note: If the translation of the desired word contains two parts, consider it without a space. For example, the word "laprogrammation" in the sample input below should be considered as "la programmation," with the space between the two parts omitted.)

The final sentence may be a combination of words from the three languages.
